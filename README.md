WvW Timers is an application that shows on live the time of Supervisors' buff of freshly caught structures in WvW. It is easy to use and very intuitive and easy to organize any WvW activity.

With it you'll never need to worry about finding yourself in the uncomfortable situation of going to capture a supply camp and that the supervisor has the invulnerability buff.
